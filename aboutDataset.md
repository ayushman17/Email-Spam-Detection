Enron Email Dataset downloaded from : https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/.
And it is the May 7, 2015 Version of dataset.


This email set is a gzipped tar file of emails stored in directories. 

This generates the following directory structure:

maildir
- $userName subdirectories for each user
- $folderName subdirectories per user
  -mail messages in folder or additional subfolders
This directory structure contains over 500,000 small mail files without attachments. These files all have the following layout:
